# Employee Attrition Excel Dashboard

# INTRODUCTION

Creating an employee attrition dashboard in Excel to analyze and visualize workforce trends.
The steady decline in the number of employees is known as employee attrition. Over time, employee attrition occurs when your workforce becomes smaller. This indicates that the rate of staff churn is higher than the rate of hiring. Employee attrition occurs when workers quit, retire, or aren't replaced at all.

The field of employee attrition analytics is primarily concerned with determining the reasons for voluntary employee departures, potential barriers to their departure, and the utilization of data to forecast attrition risk. Most significantly, companies can utilize this kind of employee predictive analytics to comprehend and create the solutions that will have the most impact on lowering unintended attrition.
